# surfs_up
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
###### W. Avy enlisted our help because of our knowledge of SQLite. We had to compare weather data for the months of June and December to determine if the ice cream and surf shops would be sustainable year round. 
## Results
* ###### The temperatures in December versus June are not drastically different. The low in December is only 56 compared to the low of 64 in June.

* ###### The high in December was 83 compared to 85 in December.

* ###### The mean was 74 in December compared to 71 in June.

## Summary
###### Based on our data, W. Avy should be fine opening up ice cream and surf shops, it seems like it would be sustainable year round since temperatures don't dip drastically in the winter.
